# Inheritance
Any inherited contract will have access to the functions and variables of the parent contract.

In Solidity, we can inherit a contract using the `is` keyword.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.8;
import "./SimpleStorage.sol";

contract ExtraStorage is SimpleStorage {
}
```

Now, the contract ExtraStorage is same as SimpleStorage. It has access to the functions and variables of SimpleStorage. We can even deploy it and it will work the same way as SimpleStorage.

# Changing Stuff in the Child Contract
Let us say you want the store function to be slightly altered in the child contract. You want to store `favNum + 5` instead.

If you try to create a function with the same name in the child contract, it will throw an error. This is because the function is already defined in the parent contract.

This is where virtual and override keywords come in.

# Virtual and Override

## Virtual
If you want to change a function in the child contract, you need to make it virtual in the parent contract. This makes the function overridable. In this case, we will make the store function virtual in the `SimpleStorage` contract.

## Override
Override is used to override a function in the child contract.

We can override the store function in the child contract by adding the `override` keyword. We can change the logic of the function in the child contract. In this case, we will store `favNum + 5` instead of `favNum`.

# Final Code

We see that when we call the store function, it stores `15` instead of `10`.
