# Importing
We can import other contracts into our contract. This is useful for reusing code and for interacting with other contracts.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.8;
import "./SimpleStorage.sol";
```

# Interacting with other contracts
Let us create a new file StorageFactory.sol and import SimpleStorage.sol into it. 

We will create an array of SimpleStorage contracts and then create a function to create a new SimpleStorage contract and add it to the array.

Let us now create a function `sfStore` to store a number at a particular index in the array. This index will contain a `SimpleStorage` contract. We will make this function public.

We access the contract object at a particular index in the array. We can then call the `store()` method on that particular contract and pass the number to be stored.

Now we will create a function `sfGet` to get the number stored at a particular index in the array. This index will contain a SimpleStorage contract. We will make this function public and view as it does not modify the state of the contract.

Here, you see that we can access the contract object at a particular index in the array. We can then call the `retrieve()` method on that particular contract.

Finally we get the output as follows:

# Blue vs Orange button

Blue buttons do not modify the state of the contract. They are read-only functions.

Orange buttons modify the state of the contract. They are write functions and cost gas.
