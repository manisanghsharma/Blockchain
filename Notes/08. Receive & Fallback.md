We have now built a simple contract which can receive Ether and store it in the contract.

Every contract has an address as we have seen in the previous chapter. This address can receive Ether from other addresses.

What if someone send Ether directly to our contract address via metamask? How can we store the funder in the contract?

This is where receive() and fallback() functions come into play.

## Receive

The `receive()` function is a special function that is executed whenever the contract receives Ether by a wallet directly. We do not need to add the `function` keyword to the receive function.

Receive function must be `external` and `payable`.

So we can make it so whenever soemone sends Ether to our contract address, `fund()` function is executed.

```solidity
receive() external payable {
        fund();
    }
```

## Fallback
The `fallback()` function is executed whenever we are sent some `data` along with Ether. Rest it is same as `receive()` function.

```solidity
fallback() external payable {
        fund();
    }
```

We can simulate these interactions by using the Low Level Interactions in Remix.

## Fallback vs Receive
This is a nice flowchart to understand what function is executed when.

```solidity
// Ether is sent to contract
    //      is msg.data empty?
    //          /   \ 
    //         yes  no
    //         /     \
    //    receive()?  fallback() 
    //     /   \ 
    //   yes   no
    //  /        \
    //receive()  fallback()
```
