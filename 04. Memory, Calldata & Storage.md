# EVM Overview
- EVM stands for **Ethereum Virtual Machine**. 
- It is a sandboxed environment for executing smart contracts.
- Even can access and store information in six places:
    - Stack
    - Memory
    - Storage
    - Calldata
    - Return Data
    - Logs

We will only be looking at memory, calldata and storage as a function can only be assigned these three.

## Memory
Memory keyword is used for such variable that are only needed for a short period of time. 

For example, while using a function, we might need to use the memory keyword as the variables are required only for a short period of time.

## Calldata
Calldata is also like memory but it is read only, the value cannot be changed.

## Storage
Storage is used to store the value permanently. It is used to store the value in the blockchain. It is expensive to use storage.

By default, all the varaibles are stored in storage.

## Note
The memory and calldata are only required for `arrays`, `structs`, `mappings` and `strings`. For other variables like `uint` and `int`, the memory and calldata keyword is not required. 

If we try to give a memory or calldata keyword to a variable like `uint` or `int`, it will give an error.

Genrally we need to use memory and calldata keyword for arrays, structs, mappings and strings, especially when we are passing them as arguments to a function.

Here we gave memory to `_name` and `newperson` but not to `_favNum`
